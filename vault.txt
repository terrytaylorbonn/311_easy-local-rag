9/5/2023 1 AN INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTERS COMPILED BY HOWIE BAUM WHAT IS A COMPUTER ?A computer is a programmable electronic machine used to store, retrieve, and process data.They are used to type documents, send e -mail, play games, browse the Internet, create presentations, event invitations, and listen to music or watch videos.3Laptop 9/5/2023 Chromebook 9/5/2023 4WHY IS A COMPUTER SO EFFICIENT ?▪It doesn’t get tired !!▪The ability to work on projects with amazing speed ▪Reliability (low failure rate) ▪Very Accurate ▪Able to store huge amounts of data and information ▪Able to communicate with other computers 5 9/5/2023HARDWARE VS.SOFTWARE - Before we talk about different types of computers, let's talk about two things all computers have in common: Hardware and Software.• HARDWARE is any part of your computer that has a physical structure that you can touch , such as the computer itself, the keyboard, or the mouse, which you can see in the image below.
• It also includes all the computer's internal parts. SOFTWARE - Software is any set of instructions, sometimes called a program, that tells the hardware what to do and how to do it .Examples of software include web browsers, games, and word processors.Below, you can see an image of Microsoft PowerPoint, which is used to create presentations, like this one.Everything you do on your computer will rely on both hardware and software .For example, right now you may be viewing this lesson that is in a PowerPoint presentation software and the instructor is using a mouse or the keyboard (hardware) to click from page to page.6 9/5/2023 WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF COMPUTERS?When most people hear the word computer , they think of a personal computer such as a desktop or laptop .However, computers come in many shapes and sizes, and they perform many different functions in our daily lives.
When you withdraw cash from an ATM, scan groceries at the store, or use a calculator, you're using a type of computer. 7 9/5/2023 PCS AND MACS Personal computers come in two main styles: PC and Mac.Both are fully functional, but they have a different look and feel, and many people prefer one or the other.This type of computer began with the original IBM PC that was introduced in 1981.Other companies began creating similar computers, which were called IBM PC Compatible (often shortened to PC).Today, this is the most common type of personal computer, and it includes the Microsoft Windows operating system.8 9/5/2023 MAC The Macintosh computer was introduced in 1984, and it was the first widely sold personal computer with a graphical user interface , or GUI (pronounced gooey ).All Macs are made by one company ( Apple ), and they always use the MacOS operating system.They are usually a lot more expensive than a PC type of computer.
9 9/5/2023 Laptop computers HYBRID LAPTOP COMPUTERS You can also buy a laptop that has a removable monitor screen that becomes a touch screen tablet when removed from the bottom part, such as the Microsoft Surface and other brands . 10 9/5/2023 MOBILE DEVICES - A mobile device is a general term for any type of portable handheld computer .Some mobile devices —like tablets , e-readers , and smartphones —are powerful enough to do many of the same things you can do with a desktop or laptop computer.TABLET COMPUTERS - Like laptops, tablet computers (sometimes called a Pad) are designed to be portable.However, they provide a different computing experience.They usually come in two sizes – 7 or 10 inch, as measured on a diagonal, on the screen.The most obvious difference is that tablet computers don't have keyboards, a CD/DVD drive, or touchpads.Instead, the entire screen is touch -sensitive, allowing you to type on a virtual keyboard and use your finger or a stylus, as a mouse pointer.
11Some newer Tablets also have smart phone capability and are called Phablets. 9/5/2023 12 Some persons like to use a keyboard with a Tablet, so some models come with the keyboard that is part of a protective case, around the Tablet.Other types have a separate wireless keyboard that can be used with the Tablet.9/5/2023 E-BOOK READERS —also called e-readers —are similar to tablet computers, except they are mainly designed for reading e-books (digital, downloadable books).Notable examples include the Amazon Kindle , Barnes & Noble Nook , and Kobo .Most e -readers use an e-ink display, which is easier to read than a traditional computer display.You can even read in bright sunlight, just like if you were reading a regular book.E -books can also be read on tablets , smartphones , laptops , and desktops .You can download all types of E -Books for free, from the Public library, other sites, and Amazon too.
13 9/5/2023 SMARTPHONES - In addition to the same basic features —phone calls, voicemail, text messaging — smartphones can connect to the Internet over Wi -Fi or a cellular network (which requires purchasing a monthly data plan ). This means you can use a smartphone for the same things you would normally do on a computer, such as checking your email, browsing the Web, or shopping online.Smartphones use a touch -sensitive screen, so you type on a virtual keyboard with your fingers or a stylus, to interact with the display.Other standard features include a high -quality digital camera, the ability to play digital music and video files, and use it as a GPS device for driving directions.For many people, a smartphone can actually replace electronics like an old laptop, digital music player, and digital camera in the same device.14 9/5/2023You can download music or audio books for free from the Public Library, Amazon, and use Bluetooth technology to listen with headphones, or in your car.
OTHER TYPES OF COMPUTERS - Many of today's electronics are basically specialized computers , though we don't always think of them that way. Here are a few common examples: Wearables : Wearable technology is a general term for a group of devices —including fitness trackers and smartwatches —that are designed to be worn throughout the day.Game consoles: A game console is a specialized type of computer that is used for playing video games on your TV.TVs: Many TVs now include applications —or apps —that let you access various types of online content.For example, you can stream video from the Internet directly onto your TV.SERVERS - A server is a large, high -speed computer that are stacked together, to provide information to other computers on a network and are usually used for places that need to store and retrieve a lot of information .For example, whenever you use the Internet, you're looking at something that's stored on a server.
Many businesses also use local file servers to store and share files internally. 16 Watch the video below to see a summary about what a computer is: 9/5/2023 HIGH SPEED, SERVER DATA CENTER Bit - The smallest amount of memory which represents a 0 or a 1 Byte - A byte, is made of 8 bits and usually stores one character such as a letter or a number or symbol.(C or 5 or %) Therefore, a computer with 8 Megabytes of memory can store about 8 million characters.One megabyte can hold approximately 768 pages of text information.A Byte = 8 bits = 1 letter, number, or a symbol Kilobyte (KB) = 1 Thousand Bytes Megabyte (Mb) = 1 Million Bytes Gigabyte (GB) = 1 Billion Bytes Terabyte (TB) = 1 Trillion Bytes AMOUNT OF MEMORY IN COMPUTERS The Power button symbol, on a device 9/5/2023 18 - 768 pgs of printed text.
or a stack of 262 feet of printed pages or a 51 mile stack of printed pages 19 9/5/2023 THE HARD DRIVE HARD DRIVE – It is where your software, documents, and other files are stored permanently . It contains long-term memory storage , which means the data is still saved even if you turn the computer off or unplug it.When you use a program to work on a document, they both usually are stored on the hard drive.When you save a file, the data is copied back to the hard drive .The faster the hard drive, the faster your computer can start up and load programs .The type of Hard Drive shown is the older type and uses an electric motor to turn 1 or more platters where the computer information is stored.Within the last few years, it has been replaced by Solid State drives (SSD) .

(30 trillion bytes !) It’s enough to store 5,700 full length, High Definition movies !!!9/5/2023 22 6 ADVANTAGES OF SOLID -STATE MEMORY DRIVES 1)More durable and damage resistant 2)Faster speed than the older type of hard drives 3)They are lighter so the laptop is easier to carry 4)More efficient and reliable than the older type of hard drives.5)They use less electricity, so the battery lasts longer 6)No moving parts to wear out so they last a lot longer.9/5/2023 KEYBOARD - The keyboard is one of the main ways to communicate with a computer.More information about all of the keys on the keyboard will be given in a separate presentation about the keyboard, Trackpad, and/or mouse.
23 9/5/2023 THE MOUSE The mouse is another important tool for communicating with computers. It lets you point to objects on the screen, click on them, and move them.The optical mouse is the type used today.It has an LED light on the bottom that senses how you move the mouse, which moves the cursor on the screen to where you want it, You can buy one with a cord or a wireless mouse.9/5/2023 26BLUETOOTH WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY Bluetooth is a short -range wireless connection that is used in modern smartphones and wireless devices.It works up to 33 feet away.It is used with Wireless Computer devices like keyboards, a mouse, headphones, speakers, etc.A wireless mouse has a battery in it and comes with a small USB connector, called a Dongle that uses Bluetooth technology to send the signal to the computer 9/5/2023 9/5/2023 27BLUETOOTH TECHNOLOGY The symbol for Bluetooth technology is a combination of the Nordic runes for H and B, which refer to the 10th century King, Harald Bluetooth.
Bluetooth technology is a short - length, radio link that is meant to unite devices the same way that King Harald Bluetooth united the tribes of Denmark into a single kingdom. COMPUTER SOFTWARE Computer software is the key to productive use of computers.Software can be categorized into 2 types: 1.APPLICATION SOFTWARE, like Word Processing (Word or WordPad), Spreadsheets (Excel or Google sheets), E-mail programs (Outlook or G-mail) 2.OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE , like Windows 10 or 11.THE OPERATING SYSTEM Anoperating system is the most important software that runs on a computer.Ours is Windows 10 (or 11 on newer PC computers) It manages the computer's memory &processes , as well as all of its software andhardware .It also allows you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's language.Without an operating system, a computer is useless .Information about Operating Systems will be discussed in the presentation about Windows 10.
30 9/5/2023 Modern operating systems use a Graphical User Interface , orGUI(pronounced gooey ). A GUI lets you use your Touchpad or Mouse to click on icons ,buttons , and menus , and everything is clearly displayed on the screen using a combination of images and text.Each operating system's GUI has a different look and feel, so if you switch to a different operating system, it may seem unfamiliar at first.However, modern operating systems are designed to be easy to use , and most of the basic principles are the same.31 9/5/2023 MAC OS is a line of operating systems created by Apple.It comes preloaded on all new Macintosh computers, or Macs.According to StatCounter Global Stats , Mac OS X users account for about 20% of global operating systems —much lower than the percentage of Windows users.One reason for this is that Apple computers tend to be more expensive.However, many people do prefer the look and feel of Mac OS X over Windows.
32 9/5/2023 Linux (pronounced LINN -ux) is a family of open -source operating systems, which means they can be modified and distributed by anyone around the world. This is different from proprietary software like Windows , which can only be modified by the company that owns it.The advantages of Linux are that it is free, and there are many different distributions — or versions —you can choose from .According to StatCounter Global Stats , Linux users account for 2.1% of global operating systems.However, most servers run Linux because it's relatively easy to customize.33 9/5/2023 34WHO USES LINUX?- YOU PROBABLY ALREADY USE LINUX, WHETHER YOU KNOW IT OR NOT.
Companies and individuals choose Linux for their servers because it's secure, flexible, and you can receive excellent support from a large community of users, It is also the background Operating System for many devices you probably own, such as: ▪Between 33% to 67% of the webpages on the Internet are generated by servers, running Linux. ▪85% of all smartphones ▪Chromebook laptop computers ▪Personal video recorders ▪Digital cameras ▪Electronic wearable devices ▪Your car has Linux running under the hood ▪The world’s top 500 fastest supercomputers all run on Linux.9/5/2023 OPERATING SYSTEMS FOR MOBILE DEVICES The operating systems we've been talking about so far were designed to run ondesktop andlaptop computers.Mobile devices such as phones ,tablet computers , and MP3 players are different from desktop and laptop computers, so they run operating systems that are designed specifically for mobile devices.Examples of mobile operating systems include Apple iOS andGoogle Android .
35 9/5/2023 WHAT IS AN APPLICATION? You may have heard people talking about using aprogram , anapplication , or an app.But what exactly does that mean?Simply put, an appis a type of software that allows you to perform specific tasks .Applications for desktop or laptop computers are sometimes called desktop applications , while those for mobile devices are called mobile apps .Usually, they can be downloaded inexpensively or free.Watch the video below to learn more about applications.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gMOYZoMtEs &feature=emb_logo 1.5 min36 9/5/2023 DESKTOP APPLICATIONS There are countless desktop applications, and they fall into several categories.Some are full featured (likeMicrosoft Word ), while others may only do one or two things (like a clock orcalendar app).WORD PROCESSORS: A word processor allows you to write a letter, design a flyer, and create many other types of documents.Examples: WordPad and Microsoft Word .
MEDIA PLAYERS - This may already be in your computer. If you want to listen to music, someone talking in a Podcast, or watch movies you've downloaded, you'll need to use a media player, which is free software that you can download to your computer.For the Windows Media Player, go to www.Microsoft.com and for the iTunes player, go to www.Apple.com379/5/2023 GAMES - There are many types of games you can play on your computer.They range from card games like Solitaire to action games like Halo.Many action games require a lot of computing power , so they may not work unless you have a newer computer.38 9/5/2023 MOBILE APPS Desktop and laptop computers aren't the only devices that can run applications.You can also download apps for mobile devices like smart phones andtablets .Here are a few examples of mobile apps.Gmail : You can use the Gmail app to easily view and send emails from your mobile device.It's available for Android andiOS (Apple) devices.
39 9/5/2023 9/5/2023 41WINDOWS AND BROWSER UPDATES The Microsoft company regularly provides free updates to download and install patches to fix bugs, vulnerabilities, or improve the overall experience for using your PC computer or device . Keeping your Windows 10 (or 11) operating system and any Microsoft programs updated, is one of the most important steps in protecting yourself from viruses, malware, and other Internet security threats.Be sure to accept any “OK to update ?” message from Microsoft or from one of the Internet browsers you use, such as Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.Usually, this process happens automatically, as long as you keep your computer on, even in “Sleep” mode.The computer should be turned off by closing all the software being used ( Wordpad , Word,etc .), and making sure you saved all of your documents, before turning off the power.NEVER TURN THE COMPUTER OFF BY PRESSING THE POWER BUTTON !How to Properly Turn the Computer off X !
44 To shut down the computer, click on the “Start” (also called the Microsoft) button on the lower left corner of the screen (or on the bottom left side of the keyboard), click on “Power”, and then click on “Shut down”.
